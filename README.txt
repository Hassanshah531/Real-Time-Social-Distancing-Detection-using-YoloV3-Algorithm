SOP’s Detection is a modern project in field of computer vision (image processing).In this
project the problem is to check in a video (camera) whether humans in the video are
following SOP’s or not. Our goal is to detect the humans in the video that are not following
the main three SOP’s which are Social distancing, Face mask and Handshaking. Secondly
the task is to find a proper data set and using that data set we train the machine to monitor
every single place and detect only those which are not following SOPs like social distancing,
face mask and handshaking. The whole project is divided into parts. Firstly we detect those
humans which are on a very close distance from each other; secondly we detect the humans
which are not wearing the face mask by detecting the face first and then check for mask.
Thirdly we detect those humans which handshakes with each other. In this project we detect
2m distance between every person with respect to each other individuals by using neural
network (NN) to monitor crowd in different social places using surveillance cameras. Our
goal is to make an efficient system by using artificial.
