SOP’s Detection is a modern project in field of computer vision (image processing).In this
project the problem is to check in a video (camera) whether humans in the video are
following SOP’s or not. Our goal is to detect the humans in the video that are not following
the Social distancing SOP’s. Secondly the task is to find a proper data set and using that 
data set we train the machine to monitor every single place and detect only those which are 
not following social distancing. The whole project is divided into parts. In this project we 
detect 2m distance between every person with respect to each other individuals by using neural
network (NN) to monitor crowd in different social places using surveillance cameras. Our
goal is to make an efficient system by using artificial.
